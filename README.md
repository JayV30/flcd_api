# flcd_api: The FlashCard API

## Mission

The goal of this project is to set up a stable, simple, and powerful REST API 
for students. We want to provide the following to the community:

  1. A REST API that web development students can utilize to practice building
     front-end applications on a variety of platforms.
  2. A flash card application that can be used to study for *any* subject.

Students of all types are welcome to build with our API, or just use our 
application to make and share digital flash cards.

## The API

### Introduction

The API itself is built with:
  * Node.js
  * Express
  * Passport
  * PostgreSQL

To access or API, you will need to sign up for a regular user account [*here*](#). 
Then go into your account settings and press "generate api key". This key will 
be required for your application to access the API. You can generate a new key 
at any time by pressing the button. However, this will invalidate any keys you 
have previously generated. *more details to come...* 

We encourage contributions to this project! Please keep your contributions 
limited to the API, and don't send pull requests than include any sort of 
front-end application. Review our [*contribution guidelines*](#) before starting.
